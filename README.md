*(Just kidding. But you *are* here, which means you're already feeling it.)*

Pop-Up Panic is a lovingly AI-crafted descent into digital madness — a browser experience written almost entirely by Copilot CLI and various models (mainly claude-opus-4.5) that weaponizes your internet childhood against you. Remember dial-up modems? Dancing banana GIFs? Ads that screamed "YOUR COMPUTER HAS A VIRUS" in Comic Sans? This app remembers. This app *is* those ads.

Every era of internet advertising — from the blinking GeoCities banners of the 90s to the passive-aggressive cookie consent popups of today — has been painstakingly recreated by an AI that has read far too many terrible websites and now wants to share the trauma. The result is a relentless, anxiety-inducing parade of nostalgia that asks the deep question: *was the internet always this chaotic, or did we just get used to it?*

The answer is yes. The answer has always been yes.
